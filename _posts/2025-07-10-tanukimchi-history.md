## 🐾 What is Tanukimchi?

Imagine a **tanuki** (Japanese raccoon dog) and a bowl of spicy, tangy **kimchi** had a child. That's right — it's Tanukimchi. 

It's not just a name. It's a vibe. A state of mind. A blogging spirit 🧠🔥

## 📚 The Mythical Origins

Legend has it that Tanukimchi was born when:

1. A rogue tanuki wandered into a Korean BBQ party 🍖
2. It accidentally fell into a vat of kimchi 🫙
3. Instead of escaping, it **meditated for 100 days**, absorbing the spice and soul of fermented cabbage

> Since then, it wanders the internet, blessing markdown posts with spicy insights.
